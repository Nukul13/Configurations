1. How to install a package inside virtualenv (which is already installed in host)?

Well i don't have an appropriate reason regarding why this behavior occurs but then i just found a small work around

Inside the VirtualEnvironment
----------------------------------------------
pip install -Iv package_name==version_number
----------------------------------------------
now this will install the version in your virtual environment

Additionally you can check inside the virtual environment with this
----------------------------------------------
pip install yolk
yolk -l
----------------------------------------------
This shall give you the details of all the installed packages in both the locations(system and virtualenv)

While some might say its not appropriate to use --system-site-packages (it may be true), but what if you have already done a lot of stuffs inside your virtualenv? Now you dont want to redo everything from the scratch.


2. Installing Jupyter in virtual env and configure ipython kernel

# Then install jupyter within the active virtualenv (use version which is latest)
(testenv)$ pip install -Iv jupyter==1.0.0

# jupyter comes with ipykernel, but somehow you manage to get an error due to ipykernel, then for reference ipykernel package can be installed using:
(testenv)$ pip install -Iv ipykernel

#Next, set up the kernel (Replace 'testenv' with 'tensorflow' as virtenv)
(testenv)$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name testenv --display-name "Python2 (testenv)"
