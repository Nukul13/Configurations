## Interactive Fusion Learning versus compartmental approach

Its tempting to linearize and standardize learning methods so a sequence can be followed by a group and expect all of them to be good at it. But what actually happens is humans are inherently different and divergent. Everyone is unique and have potential to excel in their unique interests.

Most creative learning happens in a very non-linear fashion, where one first get introduced to a problem and then begin to argue possibilities of solutions or nature of it. A search begins to find tools and mechanisms available to approach that problem. Initial failiure is what you get and you slowly start to understand its nature and behaviour from experimenting with it. This is where one starts systematic observation and noting down properties, characteristics and constraints of problem.

In the [most viewed TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) of all time, education expert Sir Ken Robinson argues that by stigmatizing mistakes, our school systems destroy the children’s innate creative capacity. “If you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never end up with anything original,” says Robinson.

Another example is, the following excerpt is from one of Richard Feynman’s letters in response to a woman who had written to him with great admiration of his lectures. It gives us the perfect glimpse into Richard’s process for how one should go about learning anything:
"It seems to me that there is some chance that you may be successful since you say you have not studied physics in a disciplined fashion. So much the better, but study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible."
